                    <p>Welcome to my world of diverse passions and professional experiences! My journey has been an exciting blend of technology, agriculture, and adventure, all of which have shaped me into a versatile and driven individual.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Education</h2>
                        <p>I hold a BSc in Information Technology from Northwest University (2020-2023), which has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, software development, and IT systems. Alongside this, I have also completed a BCom in Agriculture Economics and Risk Management (2017-2020) at the same institution, with a focus on economics, risk analysis, and agricultural systems.</p>
                        <p>I expanded my skills with an online course in Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through Duke University on Coursera, which introduced me to web development fundamentals.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                        <p>Currently, I serve as a System Administrator at KHUSA Consulting, where I manage and optimize CRM systems, analyze business problems, and develop solutions using Python scripting and Power BI for data manipulation and reporting. Prior to this, I worked as an Administrative Consultant at KHUSA, honing my skills in client relations, data analysis, and collaboration with major medical schemes and gap cover providers.</p>
                        <p>Before stepping into the IT world, I gained valuable life skills in diverse roles—from managing teams on a construction site to assisting with planting and irrigation during farming projects. I also worked as a camp facilitator, leading outdoor activities that strengthened my people skills and taught me the art of leadership and adaptability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                        <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Software Development: Exploring innovative ways to create software applications.</li>
                                <li>Farming and Beekeeping: A nod to my agricultural roots and love for nature.</li>
                                <li>Hunting and Fishing: Enjoying the tranquility and challenges of the outdoors.</li>
                                <li>Underwater Hockey: A unique and dynamic sport that combines strategy and physical fitness.</li>
                            </ul>
                    <br>  
                    <h2>A Blend of Skills</h2>
                        <p>My educational background and work experience have provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, data analysis, and team management. Combined with my hobbies and interests, I bring a balanced perspective to every challenge—whether it's crafting a new software application or planning an irrigation system on a farm.</p>
                    <br>   
                    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                        <p>I thrive on learning, adaptability, and finding innovative solutions. Whether it’s exploring the latest in server management or building tools to streamline workflows, I am always eager to expand my skill set and contribute meaningfully.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Feel free to connect, I’d love to collaborate or share ideas!</p>
